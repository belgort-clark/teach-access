# Clark College Universal Design Committee

During the 2018-2019 academic year the college formed a working group to create a "Universal Design" committee. I participated in this group and helped draft the document that was sent to the Clark College Executive Cabinet for approval. The [enclosed document](Proposed-UD-Committee-Admin-Proc.docx) is what the group submitted for approval.

Various college employees including Disability Support Services, Administration, Student Affairs and Instruction were all represented on the team.

## Text from the Draft

Currently Clark does not have a cross-campus group coming together to proactively address physical barriers for those with disabilities. We believe this is necessary to support Clark’s mission and commitment to the core themes and their objectives, specifically Social Equity (to create and sustain an accessible and inclusive environment) and Environmental Integrity (to continually improve the college’s physical, digital, and social environments). This work can also support goal four of our Academic Plan with the improvement of physical spaces.  We want Clark to envision an “inclusive environment” meaning one that is for people of varying abilities including those with disabilities.

Clark’s Universal Design Committee will strive to create a more inclusive, accessible campus for those of all abilities. Since Universal Design is a broad term in education, this group will often use the terms universal accessibility or physical accessibility to describe our main focus. We define physical accessibility as: assessing the built everyday environment for full usability for those of all abilities, (especially those with physical disabilities). Universal accessibility refers to the everyday built and digital/online environments.

This committee will devise its annual or bi-annual strategies and projects based on: (1) feedback from the campus community on physical/digital barriers, (2) physical accessibility strategies named in our campus’ Social Equity Plan, and (3) 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design. 

Our committee will serve as an advocacy committee for accessibility considerations of Clark’s built/physical and digital/online environments to campus stakeholders. Our group will report to the Social Equity Council, as aligns with Clark’s Core Theme white paper.
