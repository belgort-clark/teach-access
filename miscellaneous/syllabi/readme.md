# CTEC 122 Syllabus and Web Development AAT Program Outcomes

The [Syllabus for CTEC 122](ctec122syllabus.docx) does not currently contain any mention of creating accessible websites.

The same goes for the [Program Outcomes](https://catalog.clark.edu/academic-plans/computer-technology/web-development-aat/) for the Clark College Web Development program.

Recommendations are currently being made to our Industry Advisory Committee to modify both the course and program outcomes to include accessibility.

The next meeting of this group will be during the Fall of 2019. A report will be made back to Teach Access with the committees recomendations.
