# What is Web Accessibility

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has developed the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). The WAI provides strategies, standards and resources to make the web accessible to people with disabilities.

Unfortunately, when sites aren't designed and developed correctly, they can present barriers for people with disabilities.

Visit the site below and explore the vast amount of information available to assist not only you, the web developer but others including content writers, designers, developers, evaluators and testers, managers, policy makers, trainers, educators, web users, people with disabilities and other advocates.

**Be sure to read through the site and watch any and all videos.**
