# The World Wide Web is for Everyone

The World Wide Web is an amazing platform that allows people to publish and consume content which can then be accessed by anyone around the world using a web browser.

While people can type in a website address into their web browser and be brought to any website, web developers, web designers, and content creators must consider how people with disabilities can read, listen, watch, interact and navigate through your site.

An important but frequently overlooked part of web design and development is taking into account how people with disabilities will use your site. It's important to make sure that all people can interact and use your site the way you intended it to be used.

It's not just web developers and designers that need to consider who and how people will be using the things that they design. It's designers of all types. Ones that design buildings, parks, environments, sidewalks or just about anything! 

## Inclusive Design

We use the term "inclusive design" to refer to the wide range of user diversity when creating things, both digital and physical.

Imagine an architect that designed a skyscraper only to be told after the building was completed that it had to be significantly modified to include wider hallways and ramps for wheelchair accessibility.

The same goes for web developers and designers. We need to ensure that we consider providing access to everyone. Sometimes you may hear this called "universal design". For the purposes of , we can use "universal design" and "inclusive design" interchangeably.  

## What is a Disability?

I'm sure that you know that people who are blind won't be able to read the content on your web pages without the use of "assistive technology". They will most likely use what are called "screen readers" which can read the contents of the web page to the user. 

Similarly, people who have hearing impairments will use "closed captioning" when watching a video or read a transcript instead of listening to a podcast.

Blindness and deafness are disabilities. There are many other disabilities that people can have that will affect the way they interact with the web.

## The Americans with Disabilities Act

In 1990 the US Government passed and signed into law the [Americans with Disabilities Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990), or ADA for short. The ADA is a civil rights law that prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in all areas of public life, including jobs, schools, transportation, and all public and private places that are open to the general public.

The ADA also requires covered employers to provide reasonable accommodations to employees with disabilities and imposes accessibility requirements on public accommodations.

This act defines disability as:

A person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activity.

## Types of Disabilities

Prior to reading this section, Exercise No. 1 should be completed. It's an in-class group activity. The exercise should be allotted 20 minutes of time.

Here's a list of common disabilities that require web developers and designers to consider when creating new sites and site content:

- Blind and Low Vision
- Deaf and Hearing Impaired
- Mobility / Dexterity (fine motor control, low-strength, single handedness)
- Cognitive (attention, memory-related, literacy, routines/predictability)
- Vestibular (balance)
- Speech
- and others

## Equal Access for All Web Users

Now you are probably wondering what all of this has to do with this course on HTML Fundamentals.

Well, it's our job to ensure that the things we create on the web can be consumed by everybody. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has developed several sets of guidelines that can help web developers create sites that everyone, regardless of their disability can use and access equally.

We will be looking more at these guidelines in other modules.
