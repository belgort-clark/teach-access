# Exercise No. 1

In this module, you learned about two disabilities: blindness and deafness. In this exercise you are going to try and identify a list of other disabilities and what assistive technology can be used to help them interact with a computer and web browser.

Students will have 20 minutes to complete this exercise.

## Directions

1. Students should break into small groups of 3-5 people
2. Using either a whiteboard or a piece of paper, develop a list of disabilities
3. When developing the list of disabilities, keep in mind ones that would impact a person's use of technology such as a computer and web browser
4. Next, to each disability that you listed, include examples of how you think assistive technology can help them use the computer and a web browser
5. Each group of students will report back their results to the class
