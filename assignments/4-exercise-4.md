# Exercise 4 - Simulating Macular Degeneration

In this exercise you will simulate what's it's like for people with macular degenration to use the web. You are to write down your experiences on a piece of paper or in a digital document. You will then be asked to participate in a class discussion after your analysis.

The instructor will provide you with small pieces of paper or plastic straws. You will use then look through the straws to experience how a person with macular degeneration will navigate through several websites.

If you don't have straws, you can cup your hand by making a fist and then losening up your hand.

## Step 1

Select three of the five websites listed below and for each one of the three websites you select, answer the questions listed in Step 2:

- **Clark College** - [http://www.clark.edu](http://www.clark.edu)
- **The Columbian** â€“ [http://www.columbian.com](http://www.columbian.com)

## Step 2

Using the straw or your fist, try and navigate the sites you selected in Step 1. Record your experiences.

The class will then share their experiences.

As an instructor, be sure to use the straw test in future design assignments to help assess how easy or hard it is to navigate student assignments.
