# Exercise 3 - Web Content Accessibility Discussion Exercise

Throughout this course, you have learned about how important it is to design accessibility into websites.

As you continue to develop web pages it is important to keep in mind that the person who may be visiting your site may not be able to see, hear or even use the content on your pages. This is not just something nice to do, in some instances, it is the law and it is punishable by fine if these guidelines are not followed.

This is a graded Discussion. You will get seven points for a well-thought-out post and three points for a meaningful reply to one or more of your peer's posts.

## Step 1

First, re-read and watch the material in Modules 1 and 2 on [Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/user-stories/). Also, it's a good idea to keep this article from the W3C organization open while you complete this discussion exercise. It will provide an overview of what accessibility is and how your web page content is presented to everybody, regardless of disability.

Next, read the article [How People with Disabilities Use the Web](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/user-stories/). It presents various scenarios about people with disabilities and how they use the web.

## Step 2

Read the PDF document [Selected Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0](Accessibility_Guidelines_For_Web_Pages.pdf) which contains excerpts from the W3 website. This document was put together by a working group of the World Wide Web Consortium that is focused on developing guidelines for web content accessibility.

## Step 3

Select three of the five websites listed below and for each one of the three websites you select, answer the questions listed in Step 4:

- **Clark College** - [http://www.clark.edu](http://www.clark.edu)
- **The Columbian** â€“ [http://www.columbian.com](http://www.columbian.com)
- **Helen Keller National Center** - [http://www.hknc.org](http://www.hknc.org)
- **Washington State School for the Blind** - [http://www.wssb.wa.gov](http://www.wssb.wa.gov)
- **City of Vancouver, WA** - [http://www.cityofvancouver.us](http://www.cityofvancouver.us)

## Step 4

In the Discussion Forum below, do the following (include the number of the item):

- List the three sites that you reviewed from Step 3. (1 point)
- For each of the three sites, list 2 things that the site did correctly or incorrectly based on what you learned from reading the materials from Steps 1 and 2. Be sure to examine the HTML for each site and include the markup  that you critique in your submission. You must quote from the articles above the point you are trying to make. Include the article and its text. (6 points total, 2 points awarded for each site you analyze and critique.)
- Don't limit your analysis to only "alt" and "title" tags. Analyze the colors, the ability to enlarge the text, the contrast between various elements, tab order for input fields, identifying things like PDF documents and documents, as well as other aspects mentioned in the readings.

## Step 5

After you have submitted your Discussion Forum post, you will be able to see all of the other student's posts. Read through them and find one that interests you and make a meaningful reply regarding what they discovered while doing their research. Answers such as "Cool", "I like your post", and "I agree with you" are not acceptable. You need to amplify on their remarks or compare some of your findings against what they wrote. Put their name at the top of your reply post so that I know who you are replying to. (3 points).
